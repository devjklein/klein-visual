## A brief history of Me

**Hi, I'm David! I'm from Carroll County, Maryland, where I was born, raised, and currently live with my beautiful wife.**

I've pretty much always been a designer. From the time I could <del>eat</del> hold a crayon, I was imagining and drawing beautiful lands, wild animals, and unearthly monsters (so many monster drawings). My earliest memories of computer-based "design" were that of Adobe Photoshop 6.0, which my dad introduced to me when I must have been around the age of 5 by squashing, stretching, and twirling pictures of me and my siblings, much to my amusement. Since then, I have worked continuously and tirelessly to further myself as a designer, and I have learned my greatest strength is my ability to learn new skills - a strength which allows me to solve any challenge.

In 2014, I started school at Carroll Community College for Multimedia Design. There I honed my technical skills in all areas of design including visual, web, computer generated, and motion graphics. My most valuable college experience was the opportunity I had to work directly with two local businesses during an internship and as a freelance designer; this real-world experience proved invaluable in developing my professional skills while still in college.

By day, I work as a Technical Illustrator in the rail vehicle industry; by night, I like to <del>sleep</del> pursue my passion of web design. When I'm not designing for myself or freelancing, I can be found behind my camera lens and/or exploring the great outdoors with my awesome travel buddy, my wife.
