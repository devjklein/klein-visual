### Roaming Wild

## Design Process

### The challenge

Roaming Wild, a startup outdoor/adventure company, required a rugged, powerful, and versatile logo to represent and serve as the emblem of their mission to promote awareness of outdoor activities, conservation, and utilization of public lands.


### Concept Sketches

### Rationale

The RW logo mark meets this need by fusing the power and grandeur of a mountain with the company initials – a representation of the fusion of many anonymous individuals into a collective with a single goal: to explore and experience the great outdoors. Additionally, many interacting diagonal forms instill a sense of motion, a quality that functions as a call to action, while the subtle silhouette of a half hidden sun in the sky, the right “bowl” of the letter R, suggests an ongoing journey – that the best is yet to come.

Whether through hiking, skiing, hunting, or fishing, a unique quality of exploration is that it requires dexterity and versatility amidst ever-changing environments; consequently, Roaming Wild required a logo with equal versatility. To satisfy this necessity, the RW logo mark is designed to be exceptionally flexible – it can be reproduced in any color on any contrasting background, and with tactfully crafted simplicity, it can be recognized from distances at which it appears as small as a postage stamp. The logo typeface, Source Sans Pro Black, is simple and bold, and was chosen to reflect the values required of any tool of the outdoors, those being practicality and functionality.

The logo is available in two versions, one with a distressed grungy appearance and one without. The grungy version will be employed in most situations where retaining Roaming Wild’s rugged and weathered brand aesthetic is of the utmost importance; the clean version may be used as a substitute in situations where the grungy appearance may impede printing processes or legibility.
