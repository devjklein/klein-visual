The blog/project header should look like the second scale version of Medium: full width image, then the title and content.

# TeachingTheWord Ministries Brand

TeachingTheWord Ministries is local non-profit with a global reach and a mission of "equipping the scripture-driven church". Their weekly email newsletter reaches more than 50,000 people worldwide. With such a far-reaching ministry, the organization recognized the need for a refresh of their visual identity, complete with a new logo.

## What I did

Sketching, Wireframing, Illustration, Web Design, Motion Graphics, Copywriting

## Design Process

### Logo Concept Sketches

I first met with the client and we discussed both the direction they wanted the visual identity to take, as well as the scope of the project and final deliverables. From there, I created paper sketches of logo concepts based on our discussion; these sketches were then provided to the client for review. They liked the "shield and banner" concept the most, so I took to the computer and developed several variations of the initial design in Adobe Illustrator.

### Illustration

The client then selected a final logo from among the variations, and I polished the design based on their feedback.

### Typography

The client wished to retain the typography present in their existing logo, so I developed a modern look using the sans-serif typeface Adobe Lato.

### Rationale

As a Bible ministry, the Biblical concept of armor - the sword and shield - resonated deeply with TeachingTheWord's mission ideals. The secondary elements placed on the shield highlight their goal of equipping churches around the world with sound doctrine, while the banner references their ministry verse, found in the Book of John.

### Office Stationery

A huge part of TeachingTheWord's ministry is their worldwide distribution of printed resources via mail. With the logo complete, I brought the design to all company stationery including letterhead, envelopes, packets, and pamphlets.

### Email Newsletter

An equal half of my time working with TeachingTheWord was spent developing a new email newsletter template within their email distribution service, ConstantContact. The newsletter was designed to match both the color palette and feel of the new logo.
