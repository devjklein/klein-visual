Late last year I had the opportunity of attending a unique local event showcasing hundreds of working rare and antique steam-powered machines including tractors, sawmills, massive road-locomotives, and a plethora of stationary steam contraptions. These machines are not only a unique look into industry as it was in the 1800s and early 1900s, but they are still marvels of engineering today.

In this video I attempted to capture the rustic beauty of these machines, particularly the mesmerizing motion of the many moving parts undulating rigidly in perfect rythm.
