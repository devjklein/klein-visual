I was commissioned by the Carroll Community College Student Life Office to create a large-format poster, for utilization at several locations around the campus, that would raise awareness of the college's early registration program for returning students. Existing pamphlets contained two columns of text on the program, and did not effectively highlight its benefits.

Marketing on a campus full of busy students I knew the poster had to be absolutely eye-catching, so I developed the traffic light concept - a visual signal familiar to everyone and sure to catch the eye. Bold lettering that outlined three simple steps to register paired alongside the traffic light illustration, and additional information underneath in smaller lettering completed the design.
