# Minimal Table and Chairs
I created this interior rendering in Blender 3D based on [this] from [here]. During this project I learned a lot about lighting and scale, as well as creating modular photorealistic shaders. Blender's new Filmic color presets proved invaluable for achieving as close to a photorealistic result as possible within the final image.
