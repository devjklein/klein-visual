## What's in a website?

### 4 months. Over 150 hours.

My portfolio site is finally complete! Like any great art, however, it remains a work in progress, and of course a live website may never be truly finished - only left abandoned until the next update, the next blog post, the next flashy feature. Nevertheless, due to necessary personal deadlines I set for myself, the site is production-ready (save some performance/structural tweaks in the background) and I'm proud to release it for public consumption?

### Why a midnight release you say?

Simple. Nobody will be awake to notice any bugs on the site. *Clever*. Of course that’s not true, launching a website is no easy task and it has taken everything in my bleary-eyed, sleep-deprived self to make this project a reality. I have many plans for optimizing my site, and I love becoming absorbed in the numbers game of webpage optimization. There are many aspects of web design I wish to further explore and integrate into my website, many of these are simply time prohibited and irrelevant to the current state of the site.

### What's to come?

Over the course of the past four months, I've learned and accomplished so much more than I thought possible with the resources (and time) at my disposal. Over the coming months, I hope to share some insights I’ve gained into the process of developing a personal website from scratch, and most of all discuss some of the biggest mistakes I made, which were of course my best teachers.
I sincerely thank you for visiting my site, please feel free to comment your thoughts and critiques below, and have a great day!
